## Description
 The SHIELD Cognitive Data Analytics module extends the capabilities of the Apache Spot platform with scalable implementations of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, to provide near-real-time analytics for cybersecurity.
 
 We include here the development of several Anomaly Detection and Threat Classification models based on different Big Data Analytics frameworks. The aforementioned components are optimized to exploit the underlying CDH infrastructure and are functionally enriched, with respect to the fulfillment of SHIELD’s requirements.

This repository contains all the analytics components of the SHIELD Cognitive DA module. You can find the individual README files for each one as follows:

* [Αpache Spot v1.0] - [link] (README_spot.md)

* [Anomaly Detection] - [link] (README_anomaly.md)

* [Threat classification]- [link] (/classifier_ml/README.md and ./classifier_dl/README_classifier_DL.md)
